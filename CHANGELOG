1. Some Refactoring of code [courtesy Chu Yeow, thanks!]
2. `injour ls` now shows the latest status of each user on Injour [Idea courtesy Chu Yeow, thanks!]
3. `injour show bob` now accepts parameters to control the number of statuses that you want to see (by default shows 5)
4. Injour is now available on the browser and accepts parameters to alter the number of statuses to be displayed.
